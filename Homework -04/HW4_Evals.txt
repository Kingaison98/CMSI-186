A total of one point each for the following:

class Clock             : Exists, coding style acceptable   -  1 point
Constructor             : Freebie, since not really needed  -  1 point
tick                    : works                             -  1 point

class ClockSolver       : Exists, coding style acceptable   -  1 point
Constructor             : Exists, works properly            -  1 point
HandleInitialArguments  : works                             -  1.14 points (4/7)
   didn't handle zero degree angle and -1.0 second time slice; infinite loop occurred
   didn't handle zero second time slice argument; infinite loop occurred
   didn't handle 1801.0 second time slice argument; infinite loop occurred

main exists             : works                             -  1 point
works as advertised     : passes all tests in the series    -  8 points
   problem with java ClockSolver 90.0 1800.0: infinite loop occurred

Files in Git            : two files required                -  2 points
Coding Style overall    : coding style acceptable           -  1 point


Total 25.14 out of 27 = 93.11% which is an A-minus

Nice work!
